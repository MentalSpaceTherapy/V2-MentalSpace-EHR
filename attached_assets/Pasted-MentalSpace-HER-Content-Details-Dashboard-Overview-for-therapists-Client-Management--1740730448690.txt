•	Real-Time Updates: All widgets and summaries refresh automatically or at specified intervals to provide current data on appointments, tasks, and performance metrics.
________________________________________
2.2 Primary Functionalities (Therapist-Focused)
1.	Summary of Upcoming Sessions
o	Daily/Weekly Calendar Snapshots: Displays each session’s date, time, client name (or ID for confidentiality), session type (individual, group, etc.), and session location (telehealth or in-office).
o	Session Status Indicators: Color-coded or labeled “Confirmed,” “Pending,” “No-Show,” etc.
o	Quick Actions: Link to “View Client Chart” or “Start Note” directly from the schedule listing.
2.	Action Items & Task List
o	Pending Notes: A count of session notes awaiting completion or review.
o	Overdue Tasks: List of tasks assigned to the therapist that are past their due date (e.g., finalize a treatment plan or submit a clarification on a billing code).
o	Unsigned Documents: A dedicated prompt if any clinical notes or forms need an e-signature before being locked.
3.	Notifications & Alerts
o	New Client Forms: Alerts when a new intake form is submitted via the client portal.
o	Appointment Requests: Notifications of pending appointment requests or cancellations that need therapist approval.
o	Administrative Tasks: If assigned by an Admin (e.g., complete mandatory training or sign a new policy document).
4.	Therapist Performance & Accountability Metrics
o	Caseload Engagement: Number of clients on the therapist’s active caseload vs. how many are scheduled for sessions in a given timeframe (e.g., upcoming two weeks).
o	Completion Rate: Ratio of completed sessions vs. scheduled sessions per week or month (e.g., “You’ve completed 85% of scheduled sessions this week”).
o	Goal Tracking: Displays user-defined or practice-defined goals (e.g., “See at least 20 clients weekly,” “Maintain a no-show rate below 10%”).
o	No-Show/Cancellation Statistics: Count of no-shows or late cancellations, plus percentage over a chosen timeframe.
o	Documentation Compliance: Percentage of session notes completed within the practice-required timeline (e.g., 24 or 48 hours after the session).
o	Client Retention Rate (Therapist-Specific View): 
	Definition: How many clients remain active over a certain period compared to how many started that period (minus new intakes).
	Sample Formula: Client Retention Rate=((Active Clients at End of Period)−(New Clients Acquired During Period)Active Clients at Start of Period)×100% \text{Client Retention Rate} = \bigl(\frac{(\text{Active Clients at End of Period}) - (\text{New Clients Acquired During Period})}{\text{Active Clients at Start of Period}}\bigr) \times 100\% 
	Customization: The exact definition of “retention” can vary. For example, you might consider clients “retained” if they schedule or attend at least one session during a specific timeframe. The EHR can be configured to reflect your practice’s definition.
________________________________________

________________________________________
2.4 Additional Functional Considerations
1.	Customizable Widgets
o	Users can reorder or hide certain modules (with role-dependent restrictions) to prioritize what they need most (e.g., top-level “Caseload Engagement” or “Billing Snapshot”).
2.	Timeframe Selection
o	Switch between daily, weekly, or monthly views for schedules, no-show rates, and retention statistics.
o	Historic data filtering (e.g., “Show retention rate for the last quarter”) to track trends over time.
3.	Data Drill-Down
o	Clicking on a high-level metric (e.g., Retention Rate, No-Show Rate) opens a detailed report or graph highlighting which clients discontinued, no-showed, or dropped off.
4.	Notifications Customization
o	Each user can specify how they receive notifications (email, SMS, or in-app) and which updates are shown in their personal dashboard feed.

Below is an expanded, content-focused breakdown of the Billing Settings and Billing sub-tabs, incorporating additional depth and field-level details that might be gleaned from the newly provided video. The aim is to fully capture the various elements of client-specific billing configurations, coverage details, and invoice/claims management for a telehealth mental health practice.
________________________________________
3.2.5 Billing Settings Sub-Tab
This sub-tab configures individual client billing preferences and coverage specifics beyond the practice-wide defaults.
A. Client-Specific Billing Configuration

o	Default Practice Fee List: Displays standard rates for relevant CPT codes (e.g., 90834, 90837, telehealth add-on codes).
o	Override Rates: Staff can enable a custom fee schedule for this client (e.g., “Client is out-of-network, charge $120 per session instead of $150”).
o	Multiple Service Types: 
	Individual Telehealth Therapy Fee
	Couples/Family Telehealth Therapy Fee
	Group Telehealth Session Fee
	Psychological Testing (if applicable)
	Crisis/Extended Session Fee

2.	Coverage Details & Payer Rules
o	Primary Insurance: If integrated with an insurance clearinghouse, display real-time coverage data for telehealth sessions, including any policy notes (e.g., “Covers 100% for in-network providers up to 20 visits”).
o	Secondary Insurance: Similar fields to note coverage details, including how co-insurance or deductibles interact between payers.
o	Authorization Requirements: 
	Number of authorized sessions (e.g., 12 per calendar year).
	Start/End date of coverage (auto-trigger system alerts if coverage expires).
	Authorization code or reference number.
o	Telehealth-Specific Clauses: If the insurer has particular telehealth coverage rules (e.g., certain modifiers required on claims), the system can store those instructions here.
3.	Sliding-Scale & Special Discounts
o	Eligibility Criteria: A set of fields or checkboxes indicating household income range, sliding-scale percentage, or a grant-based discount.
o	Approval & Documentation: Option to attach or reference eligibility documents.
o	Effective Dates: Start and end date for the sliding-scale arrangement. The system can prompt staff to re-check eligibility when approaching the end date.

4. Session Documentation & Treatment Planning
•	Session Notes Tracking
1. Master Session List or Dashboard
In the current outline, we have a general notion that the EHR can list past sessions by client, therapist, or date range. However, we have not yet explicitly described how the user interface or workflow would present this list in a way that is both intuitive and compliance-friendly. Below is a more robust approach:
1.	Centralized “Session Notes” Dashboard
o	Upon logging in (or navigating to the Documentation tab), clinicians land on a Dashboard that displays all session notes. This dashboard can be a table or tile-based list containing: 
	Client Name (with quick access to the client’s chart or profile).
	Date of Service for the session.
	Session Type (e.g., Individual Therapy, Family Session, Group, Intake, or Discharge).
	Status (Draft, Pending Signature, or Finalized).
	Therapist (if the practice has multiple clinicians or if co-sign is required).
	Last Updated (timestamp for draft vs. final).
2.	Search & Filter Bar
o	Placed prominently near the top of the Dashboard, so users can quickly search by: 
	Client name or partial name (autofill suggestions might speed this process).
	Date Range (a from–to calendar picker).
	Note Type (e.g., progress, intake, discharge, etc.).
	Therapist (if staff want to see only their own notes or track a supervisee’s notes).
o	The system may also allow combining multiple filters (e.g., “Show me all progress notes from last week, for Dr. Smith, that are still in Draft”).
3.	Sorting & Grouping
o	A user can reorder the list by client name, date, or status with a single click. They might group the sessions to see all notes for the same date together, or all notes for the same client, etc.
o	This addresses a major efficiency need: letting clinicians quickly locate the notes they need to finalize or revisit.
4.	Quick Access to Documentation
o	Each row on the dashboard can have an “Edit Note” or “View Note” button that takes the clinician directly into the note editor.
o	If a note is “Pending Signature,” there could be a “Sign Note” button prompting an e-signature workflow.
________________________________________
2. Visual Indicators & Status Flags
Right now, we’ve stated that notes can be in draft or final. However, to truly flag incomplete or overdue notes, we can implement color-coding or iconography:
1.	Draft (Yellow Tag or Icon)
o	A bright, attention-grabbing color (like yellow or orange) to denote that the note is still incomplete.
o	Possibly a small text overlay stating “Draft” or “In Progress” directly in the row.
2.	Pending Signature (Orange Tag or Icon)
o	If the note is fully written but awaits e-signature, a different color icon clarifies it’s “one click away” from finalization.
o	The system might display a “Sign Now” button next to these notes, so clinicians can quickly finalize.
3.	Overdue or Non-Compliant (Red Tag or Icon)
o	If a note remains in draft beyond the practice’s policy (e.g., 48 hours after a session), the system automatically flags it.
o	The row can move to the top of the list or appear in bold red text, indicating urgency.
4.	Finalized (Green Tag or Lock Icon)
o	Once signed and locked, the note can display a lock icon or a green check, indicating it’s fully complete.
o	The system disallows further edits unless an addendum is appended (which is also visually indicated).
These visual indicators help staff see at a glance which items need immediate attention vs. which are complete and locked.
________________________________________
3. Compliance Alerts & Checks
We previously mentioned e-sign and locking, but there’s a big difference between having that as a concept and providing a user-friendly compliance mechanism. The system should actively check and alert clinicians to compliance issues before finalization:
1.	Mandatory Fields
o	If your practice requires certain data (e.g., a diagnosis, recommended intervention, session type, note length, or certain disclaimers), the system should: 
	Prompt a pop-up warning if the user tries to finalize without filling them.
	Highlight the missing field(s) in red or highlight them with an alert bubble.
2.	Character Count (Optional)
o	If your practice has a recommended or mandatory minimum text length for “Subjective” or “Assessment” fields, the system can show a character count meter in real time. If the count is below X, the user can’t finalize (or they’ll see a confirmation prompt).
3.	Overdue Notes
o	If a note is not completed within the acceptable timeframe (e.g., 24 or 48 hours post-session), the system automatically flags it as overdue and might: 
	Send an email or portal notification to the therapist.
	Show it as “At Risk” on the main dashboard.
	Possibly require a rationale for lateness, if that’s part of your compliance policy.
4.	Supervisor Co-Sign (if applicable)
o	If a user is an intern or associate counselor, the note automatically remains in a “pending co-sign” status. The system might generate a compliance alert if the supervisor doesn’t sign within the required timeframe.
o	This ensures that all supervised notes comply with licensing rules for co-signature.
________________________________________
4. Overdue / Incomplete Notes Handling
To keep the practice fully informed, the system can compile a daily or weekly “Compliance Summary”:
1.	Email or Dashboard Notification
o	A once-daily email or an EHR pop-up listing all notes that are: 
	Overdue
	Lacking mandatory fields
	“Pending Signature” for more than X days
o	This summary ensures no one misses potential compliance issues.
2.	Administrative Oversight
o	An Admin-level user can view a Practice-Wide list of incomplete or overdue notes. They can follow up with staff as needed, supporting overall compliance accountability.
________________________________________
5. Integration with Scheduling Data
Since the EHR typically knows the session schedule, it can auto-generate placeholder or “expected notes”:
1.	Auto-Creation of Draft
o	When a session is marked “Completed” on the calendar, the system automatically creates a draft note with the session date, time, client info, and assigned therapist.
o	This ensures every completed session has a corresponding note. If the note remains unstarted, it’s flagged as a “missing note.”
2.	Linking to the Billing Module
o	Once a note is finalized, it can automatically trigger or confirm billing events (like generating a claim). This helps ensure that incomplete notes don’t slip into billing or that claims are not inadvertently submitted before documentation is complete.
________________________________________
6. Rationale & Benefits
By emphasizing the Session Notes Dashboard with robust filtering, color-coding, and compliance checks, you:
•	Streamline each clinician’s daily workflow: They can instantly see which notes are pending, partially done, or overdue.
•	Reduce compliance risks: Mandatory fields and pop-up warnings help ensure every note meets the practice’s or regulatory standards.
•	Enhance accountability: Supervisors, admins, or compliance officers have a clear view of who needs to complete which notes.
•	Improve documentation quality: Character count or mandatory sections encourage thorough, consistent record-keeping.
________________________________________
Treatment Plan Module: Expanded Features
1. Visual Progress Tracking & Goal Completion
A. Progress Bars and Percentage Indicators
1.	Objective-Level Calculations
o	Each Objective can be assigned a measurable criterion (e.g., “Reduce panic attacks from 5/week to 2/week,” or “Complete daily mindfulness 5 times per week”).
o	The system automatically calculates progress by comparing the client’s logged outcomes or therapist-rated achievements to the target.
o	For instance, if the objective is “Client will reduce weekly panic attacks from 5 to 2,” and the client now averages 3 per week, the system can show approximately 66% completion (from 5 down to 3, with 2 being the ultimate goal).
2.	Bar Visualization
o	A small Progress Bar is displayed next to each objective, shading from 0% to 100% completion.
o	Color-Coding might indicate: 
	Green for 75% or above, indicating strong progress.
	Orange for moderate progress (30–74%).
	Red for minimal progress or newly created objectives (below 30% or less than a certain threshold).
3.	Aggregate Goal Completion
o	If each Goal has multiple objectives, the EHR can average the objectives’ completion rates to produce a single percentage for the entire goal.
o	A quick visual (e.g., “Goal #1: 60% completed”) indicates how close the client is to reaching that overarching outcome.
4.	Detailed Views
o	Clicking on a goal’s progress bar could open a detailed chart showing how each objective’s numeric or descriptive metric has changed over time (e.g., a line graph representing a drop in weekly panic attacks or an increase in completed self-care activities).
B. Customizable Scales
1.	Numeric Scales vs. Qualitative Measures
o	Some objectives might be purely numeric (e.g., “PHQ-9 score from 15 to 5”). Others may be qualitative or partially subjective (e.g., “Report moderate or below anxiety levels 5 days a week”).
o	The EHR supports both by offering either a numeric field (for direct progress calculation) or a rating scale (like 1–10 or 1–5 for subjective states).
2.	Therapist-Rated Progress
o	If the objective is complex or isn’t easily quantifiable, the therapist can manually enter a progress percentage or rating each week (“I estimate the client is at 40% progress toward effectively managing anger outbursts”).
o	This ensures that not every measure has to be strictly data-driven, acknowledging the complexities of clinical improvement.
________________________________________
2. Automated Reminders & Review Intervals
A. Configurable Review Periods
1.	Default Timeframes 
o	Many practices or payers require treatment plan reviews every 90 days (or 30, 60, or 180 days). The EHR can store a default interval (e.g., 90 days), automatically applying it to newly created or revised plans.
2.	Custom Schedules 
o	Some clients might need a more frequent check (e.g., every 30 days) due to high acuity or insurance mandates. The system allows the therapist or admin to set a custom reminder timeframe per client.
B. Reminder Notifications
1.	Dashboard Alerts
o	As the plan’s review date approaches (e.g., 7 days before the due date), the system generates a notification or bold highlight in the “Treatment Plans” area—“Plan #1 for [Client Name] is due for review in 7 days.”
o	If the plan is not reviewed by the due date, an overdue alert can appear in red, prompting urgent attention.
2.	Email or In-App Messages
o	Depending on practice settings, clinicians may receive an email or text or an in-app notification stating “Treatment Plan Review is due for [Client Name] on [Date]. Please update the plan or confirm progress.”
o	This ensures that busy clinicians who might not check the EHR daily still see these reminders.
3.	Supervisor Oversight (if applicable)
o	Supervisors or clinical directors can view a practice-wide list of all upcoming or overdue plan reviews to ensure staff remain compliant. This fosters accountability and prompt plan revision.
C. Reviewing & Revising a Plan
1.	One-Click “Review Now”
o	A Review Plan button or link is attached to the reminder. Clicking it opens the existing plan in editing mode, letting the clinician update goals, objectives, or progress.
2.	Versioning / Revisions
o	When the clinician finalizes a review, the EHR archives the previous version of the plan and creates a new “revision” or “Plan #2,” with updated statuses, newly added or discontinued objectives, and changed target dates.
o	This ensures a clear record of how the plan evolved over time—important for compliance and ongoing therapy evaluation.
3.	Progress Reset or Carryover
o	If a goal is met, the user can mark it “Completed”. If partially met, they might adjust the objective or set new sub-goals. The EHR can maintain the old data as historical progress while starting the next iteration with a fresh progress bar or updated metric.
________________________________________
3. Comprehensive “Treatment Plan Dashboard”
While not mandatory, combining progress tracking and reminders into a single Treatment Plan Dashboard can significantly improve the user experience:
1.	Plan Listing 
o	Each active plan is displayed with Client Name, Plan Start Date, Next Review Date, Overall Progress (average across all goals), and Days until Review or “Overdue” label.
2.	At-a-Glance Progress 
o	Color-coded bars or small donut charts show how close each plan is to completion.
o	Users can expand a plan to see each goal’s bar or numeric status.
3.	Review Overdue 
o	Plans past their due date or mandatory review timeframe appear at the top with a bright color or exclamation icon, prompting immediate attention from staff.
________________________________________
4. Benefits of These Enhancements
1.	Client Engagement 
o	Clients may access a simplified version of the progress bars or percentages in the client portal, boosting motivation and collaboration.
o	They see real, tangible feedback like “Goal 1 is 70% done. Just 30% left to go!”
2.	Clinical Accountability 
o	Automated reminders reduce the risk of outdated plans, meeting both clinical best practices and payer requirements.
o	Supervisors or practice admins can easily see if any plan is overdue.
3.	Data-Driven Adjustments 
o	Real-time numeric or percentage progress fosters more objective discussions about what’s working, and helps clinicians see if they should revise interventions.
o	If progress stalls, the system flags it, prompting a deeper conversation or change in approach.
________________________________________
5. Implementation & Practical Notes
•	Configurable: Not all objectives lend themselves to strict numeric tracking. The system can allow each objective to be designated as “Quantitative” or “Qualitative.”
•	Flexible Intervals: Some insurers want 30-day updates; others prefer 90-day. Make sure staff can override the default if needed.
•	Revision History: Storing old versions ensures a paper trail for audits, reflecting how the plan has changed and why.
•	Security & Permissions: Only authorized roles (therapists, supervisors) can finalize or revise plans, ensuring integrity of progress data.
________________________________________
1. Central Dashboard or List View for Session Notes
A. Rationale
•	A single, centralized dashboard dedicated to all notes (progress, initial assessments, discharge summaries, etc.) ensures clinicians and administrative staff can see at a glance what needs attention.
B. Functionality
1.	Unified List / Table
o	Displays columns such as Client Name, Session Date, Note Type (Initial, Progress, Discharge), Status (Draft, Final, Overdue), and Last Updated.
o	Allows staff to quickly scan multiple notes.
2.	Filtering & Sorting
o	Filter by Note Type: So staff can see only “Initial Assessments” or “Discharge Summaries.”
o	Filter by Status: Draft, Pending Signature, Completed, Overdue.
o	Sorting: By date, client, or therapist for further convenience.
o	Potential for Quick Search: A text search bar that can match partial client names or note types.
3.	Visual Indicators
o	Color-Coded Icons: A red exclamation for overdue notes, a green check for completed, an orange or yellow icon for “Draft,” etc.
o	Possibly highlight rows in light red for overdue or past-due notes, prompting immediate action.
4.	Direct Actions
o	In-line buttons like “Edit Note”, “Sign Note”, or “View Note” to streamline navigation.
o	If co-signature is required, a “Co-Sign” button or label for supervisors.
C. Benefits
•	Single Pane of Glass: Minimizes the time spent searching for individual notes.
•	Accountability: Visual flags help clinicians identify the most urgent tasks.
•	Improved Organization: Fosters a systematic approach to note management, reducing the risk of lost or forgotten notes.
________________________________________
2. Compliance & Validation
A. Rationale
•	Healthcare documentation must meet legal and regulatory standards. Built-in compliance checks guard against errors (e.g., missing diagnosis, incomplete fields).
B. Hard Stops & Warnings
1.	Mandatory Fields
o	Diagnosis Code: If required for billing or compliance, finalization is blocked until entered.
o	Session Date & Service: Must be filled out or the EHR prompts an error.
o	Recommended Interventions or other practice-specific mandatory fields.
2.	Overdue Note Flags
o	If a note remains in draft after X hours or days, the system automatically marks it as “Overdue,” possibly sending email or in-app notifications to the assigned clinician or supervisor.
3.	Error Messages
o	Before e-sign or “Final Save,” the system shows a pop-up listing any unfilled mandatory items.
o	If a user tries to bypass it, a “Hard Stop” enforces compliance: they cannot finalize the note until corrections are made.
C. Benefits
•	Ensures each note meets minimum documentation standards every time.
•	Audit-Readiness: Reduces compliance risk by catching omissions early.
•	Increases billing accuracy, since incomplete or invalid data can trigger payer denials.
________________________________________
3. Periodic Plan Review Alerts
A. Rationale
•	Many payers, as well as best clinical practices, require regular re-evaluation of treatment plans (e.g., every 30, 60, or 90 days). Automated alerts prevent overlooked reviews.
B. Automated Reminder Mechanics
1.	Default Interval
o	EHR sets a default (e.g., 90 days) upon treatment plan creation.
o	Clinicians can override if the client’s insurance or condition requires a different schedule.
2.	Countdown & Notification
o	Dashboard might display “Plan Review Due in 10 days” or “Plan Overdue” in red if the window is missed.
o	The system may also send an in-app or email notification X days before the plan is due.
3.	Review Action
o	A “Review Now” button or link in the plan interface triggers a revision workflow: the clinician updates goals, modifies interventions, and finalizes a new version or “Plan Revision #2.”
o	Historical versions remain archived for compliance.
C. Benefits
•	Clinical Accuracy: Encourages timely updates for evolving client needs.
•	Regulatory Compliance: Minimizes the risk of missing payers’ mandatory intervals.
•	Streamlined Workflow: No need for staff to manually track each client’s next review date.
________________________________________
4. Document Versioning
A. Rationale
•	Some organizations want a strict historical record for each revision. This ensures an audit trail of changes over time.
B. Implementation Details
1.	Revision Control
o	Each time a note or treatment plan is altered after finalization, the system prompts for an “Addendum” or “New Revision.”
o	The older version is locked in the database with a timestamp, user ID, and reason for change.
2.	Version History
o	A panel or timeline shows each version with: 
	Date/Time of creation.
	User who made changes.
	Summary of changes or reason for revision (e.g., “Updated diagnosis,” “Added new objective,” etc.).
3.	Comparisons (Optional, advanced feature)
o	If staff want to quickly see what changed between versions, the EHR can highlight modifications (e.g., replaced text, updated fields).
C. Benefits
•	Clear Audit Trail: Minimizes legal risk by showing exactly when and why data changed.
•	Quality Assurance: Supervisors can review prior versions to monitor evolving care.
•	Meets Higher Standards: Some accreditation bodies or states prefer robust version control.
________________________________________
5. Reporting Features
A. Rationale
•	Administrators often want aggregate data to manage operations, staff performance, or compliance trends.
B. Potential Reports
1.	Completion Timeliness
o	Show how many notes each clinician completes on time vs. how many are overdue.
o	Calculate Average Time to Finalize a note, from session date to sign-off date.
2.	Treatment Goals Met
o	Summarize how many goals have been achieved or are in Active vs. Stalled status across the practice or for an individual clinician’s caseload.
o	Could use the numeric progress data from the treatment plan module.
3.	Billing & Documentation Correlation
o	A cross-check of sessions that are billed but have no finalized note. This ensures that every claimed service has corresponding documentation.
4.	Productivity
o	Count or graph how many notes a clinician completes in a given period. Could highlight areas needing additional support or workload adjustments.
C. Benefits
•	Practice Management Insight: Understand compliance, productivity, and client outcomes at a higher level.
•	Performance Tracking: Clinicians or managers can see strengths and where improvements are needed.
•	Informed Decisions: Data helps refine scheduling, staffing, or training strategies.

Summary of Enhancements
1.	Dashboard or List View for Session Notes
o	Central table listing all notes with powerful filtering, color coding, direct editing links, and overdue flags.
2.	Compliance & Validation
o	Hard stops for mandatory fields, automated warnings for overdue notes, ensuring each note is thorough and meets legal/insurance standards.
3.	Periodic Plan Review Alerts
o	Automatic reminders for 30/60/90-day (or custom) plan reviews to keep treatment plans updated and aligned with payer or best-practice requirements.
4.	Document Versioning
o	Strict revision control for each note or treatment plan, preserving an exact historical record of changes.
5.	Reporting Features
o	Various real-time or scheduled reports for note completion timeliness, goal attainment, billing compliance, and staff productivity.

Below is a telehealth-focused expansion of the Scheduling & Calendar module. Since Coping & Healing Counseling is entirely virtual, this outline removes references to a physical “front desk” and multi-office needs, instead emphasizing time zone considerations, telehealth link generation, and client-driven scheduling scenarios.
________________________________________
5. Scheduling & Calendar (Telehealth-Only)
5.1 Calendar Management
A. Calendar Views & Time Zone Handling
1.	Daily/Weekly/Monthly Layouts
o	Daily: Displays an hour-by-hour grid for a single provider or an overview of multiple providers (color-coded).
o	Weekly/Monthly: Helps each clinician plan capacity over the longer term.
o	Toggle Buttons: Users can quickly switch between day/week/month to see immediate vs. long-range availability.
2.	Time Zone Awareness
o	Because telehealth clients (and even clinicians) may be in different regions, the system detects or prompts for the user’s local time zone.
o	Provider’s Default Time Zone: Each therapist has a preferred time zone setting in their profile.
o	Client’s Time Zone (if known): The EHR can display each appointment in the client’s local time, ensuring no confusion or missed sessions.
3.	Color-Coded Appointment Types
o	Individual Telehealth, Group Telehealth, Couples/Family Telehealth can each be assigned a distinct color or icon.
o	Status icons might indicate “Confirmed,” “Pending,” “Canceled,” etc.
4.	Conflict Detection
o	If a single clinician tries to schedule overlapping sessions, the system warns them.
o	For group telehealth sessions, the system checks if the desired time conflicts with any existing group or one-on-one session for that clinician.
________________________________________
B. Scheduling Workflows
1.	Creating a New Appointment
o	Clicking on a date/time slot or “Add Appointment” button opens a New Telehealth Session form.
o	Fields might include: Client Name, Session Type, Duration, and Telehealth Link Generation (discussed below).
2.	Recurring Appointments
o	Telehealth sessions can be set to repeat weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.
o	End date or total number of occurrences can be specified.
o	If one occurrence in the series is canceled, it only affects that date, not the entire series.
3.	Session Cancellation & Rescheduling
o	Clinicians (or the client, via portal) can cancel or reschedule with a pop-up reason (optional).
o	The system automatically updates the calendar in real time, notifies the clinician or client by email/SMS (if configured).
4.	Client Portal Scheduling (Optional)
o	Clients can request or book from the practice’s available time slots.
o	The system can confirm or prompt the assigned therapist to approve or suggest changes.
o	Appointment becomes official once the therapist confirms, sending automated reminders or a telehealth link.
________________________________________
5.2 Telehealth Session Links & Notifications
A. Secure Link Generation
1.	Automatic Telehealth Link
o	Each new telehealth appointment triggers unique or provider-specific video links (e.g., Zoom, Doxy.me, or integrated telehealth platform).
o	Stored in the appointment details, visible to both the client (in their portal or email reminder) and the clinician.
2.	Link Expiry or Waiting Room
o	If using a waiting room feature, the link can direct the client to a virtual waiting area until the therapist is ready.
o	Some telehealth platforms generate short-lived tokens; the EHR can handle that, ensuring each session is private and unique.
3.	Auto-Update
o	If an appointment is rescheduled, the telehealth link remains valid but changes date/time. If the system requires a brand-new link for each session, it regenerates automatically.
________________________________________
B. Notifications & Reminders
1.	Automated Session Reminders
o	The EHR can send email or SMS reminders to clients X hours/days before the telehealth session.
o	The reminder includes the session date/time in their local time zone and the telehealth link.
o	Clients can confirm or cancel from the reminder if integrated with the EHR.
2.	Clinician Alerts
o	Optionally, the therapist receives a day-of or hour-before notification summarizing the day’s telehealth sessions.
o	Alerts also for any client cancellations or requested rescheduling.
3.	No-Show Notifications (If desired)
o	If the client does not join the telehealth link within a certain timeframe, the system can mark them as “No Show,” or it can prompt the clinician to do so.
________________________________________
5.3 Multi-Provider Coordination & Schedules
A. Viewing Multiple Schedules
1.	Provider Filter
o	A dropdown allows the user to select a single provider’s calendar or a combined view of multiple providers.
o	Each provider’s telehealth sessions are color-coded or stacked in the time blocks.
2.	Minimal Overlapping
o	Because each therapist sets their availability, the EHR warns if they attempt to schedule two telehealth sessions at the same time.
3.	Group Telehealth Sessions
o	For group therapy, all relevant participants (clients) are added to one session.
o	The system ensures the group telehealth link is shared with each participant, while preserving privacy (i.e., BCC or portal-based invites).
________________________________________
5.4 Time Zone & International Clients
1.	Automatic Time Conversion
o	If a client is in a different region, the system displays session time in both the therapist’s and client’s time zone, to reduce confusion.
o	Email reminders likewise reflect the client’s time zone setting.
2.	Daylight Savings Considerations
o	The EHR adjusts session times automatically for upcoming daylight saving changes, with optional email warnings if a session time effectively “moves” an hour for either party.
________________________________________
5.5 Additional Options & Recommendations
1.	Calendar Sync
o	The EHR can offer iCal or Google Calendar integration, allowing clinicians to see telehealth appointments on their personal calendar if permitted.
o	Ensures no double-booking with personal commitments.
2.	Privacy Enhancements
o	If clients or clinicians prefer not to see the details of others’ schedules, role-based permissions can limit how much is visible. Only the assigned clinician sees the full client name, while others see “Busy.”
3.	Appointment Notes
o	Optionally, each appointment can have a “Notes” field for special instructions: “Client needs email confirmation,” “Check insurance coverage,” etc.
4.	Auto-Trigger Notes (Connection to Documentation)
o	After a telehealth session time passes, the system can prompt the therapist to create a Session Note in the documentation module, preventing missed notes or lag in compliance.
________________________________________
5.6 Summary & Benefits
•	Telehealth-Optimized: The system addresses multi-time zone complexities, automatic link generation, and easy rescheduling for remote sessions.
•	Flexible Views: Day, week, and month toggles ensure providers see exactly what they need for short- or long-term planning.
•	Self-Scheduling Option: An optional client portal feature to request times or confirm availability, reducing administrative overhead.
•	Notifications & Reminders: Minimizes no-shows, confusion about times, and last-minute cancellations, thereby improving the practice’s telehealth efficiency.
By focusing on telehealth workflows—especially time zone logic and secure link distribution—this scheduling module ensures a seamless experience for both clinicians and clients in a virtual mental health environment.
________________________________________
Appointment Booking (Telehealth Context)
1. Assigning Client, Therapist, & Appointment Type
1.	Select Client
o	The scheduling interface includes a search bar or drop-down for the client’s name.
o	After typing or selecting the client, the system auto-populates any relevant details (e.g., time zone, insurance coverage, or prior appointment preferences).
2.	Choose Therapist & Modality
o	The system shows a list of available therapists who provide telehealth services, potentially filtered by the client’s preferences (e.g., same therapist as before) or insurance acceptance.
o	A telehealth practice may also highlight each therapist’s availability blocks according to their time zone or personal schedule settings.
3.	Appointment Type
o	Initial Consult: Usually a longer session for intake and assessment. The system may auto-assign certain forms or disclaimers for the client to complete beforehand.
o	Follow-up (Individual Telehealth): Standard session length (e.g., 45-60 mins).
o	Group Therapy: The system can allow multiple clients to be assigned to one telehealth session, each receiving a secure link. The EHR ensures no overlap with the therapist’s other group or individual sessions.
o	Couples/Family Session: Additional fields for spouse/family member contact info or portal invites, if relevant.
4.	Time & Date Selection
o	The user picks from the available times on the therapist’s calendar. The EHR can show recommended slots based on each provider’s defined telehealth hours.
o	For recurring appointments, a small wizard might appear to set a weekly or bi-weekly series, saving time if ongoing sessions are needed.
5.	Confirmation & Client Notifications
o	Once an appointment is assigned, the EHR can generate an appointment summary.
o	If client notifications are enabled, a confirmation email or portal message is sent, containing the session date/time, telehealth link (if generated immediately), and optional instructions (e.g., “Please fill out your intake form at least 24 hours prior to session”).
________________________________________
2. Checking for Scheduling Conflicts or Staff Availability
1.	Real-Time Conflict Detection
o	When the user attempts to place an appointment on the therapist’s schedule, the system checks for existing sessions or breaks within the selected time range.
o	If the therapist already has a telehealth session that overlaps, the system issues a warning and prevents finalization unless the user overrides (if the therapist has capacity for back-to-back or partial overlaps, etc.).
2.	Time Zone Considerations
o	For a fully virtual practice, the system must handle different client vs. therapist time zones.
o	The booking form automatically converts the therapist’s set “office hours” into the client’s local time, or vice versa, ensuring no accidental double-booking across multiple time zones.
o	The system warns if the session is set outside the therapist’s typical hours (e.g., 9:00 PM local time, which might be outside their normal operating window).
3.	Availability Indicators
o	Therapists can define times they are open to new appointments, “on break,” or “not available.” The system color-codes or greys out blocked times, so the user quickly sees valid slots.
o	If group sessions are involved, the system checks whether the therapist is free during the entire group time range, preventing partial overlaps.
4.	Provider-Specific Settings
o	Some providers might only do initial consults on certain days, or see existing clients on other days. The system can incorporate these rules to avoid scheduling conflicts.
________________________________________
3. Adding Session Notes or Pre-Session Tasks
1.	Automatic Pre-Session Forms
o	If the session is an Initial Consultation, the EHR can automatically assign an Intake Packet or relevant forms (e.g., “Telehealth Consent,” “HIPAA Acknowledgment,” “Client History Form”) to the client’s portal.
o	For routine follow-up, the system can trigger PHQ-9 or GAD-7 questionnaires if the therapist wants a consistent measure prior to each session.
2.	Homework Assignment (Optional)
o	For clients in ongoing therapy, the system allows the therapist to attach “homework” tasks or instructions to the newly scheduled session. For example: 
	“Complete Mood Tracking Log for the week.”
	“Journal on these three questions.”
o	These tasks appear in the client’s portal or in the EHR’s “Tasks” tab with a due date.
3.	Session Notes Placeholder
o	After the telehealth session is booked, the EHR can generate a placeholder note for that future date. This ensures that after the session occurs, the therapist sees a “Draft Note” waiting to be filled out, reducing documentation gaps.
4.	Client Acknowledgment or E-Sign
o	For critical forms (e.g., updated consent, or specialized screening forms), the system can request the client’s e-signature before the session.
o	If the client does not complete required tasks, the EHR might flag it on the therapist’s session view or send an automated reminder to the client.
________________________________________
Overall Workflow
1.	Therapist or Admin chooses New Appointment → picks Client, Therapist, Session Type, Time/Date.
2.	System checks for availability: no conflicts, within working hours, time zone alignment.
3.	System auto-generates telehealth link (if integrated) or placeholders for that link, then sends a confirmation to the client’s portal or email.
4.	(Optional) The system prompts the user to attach any pre-session forms or “homework” tasks.
5.	Client receives reminders (e.g., 24 hours before) with the telehealth link, final details, and a list of forms to complete.
6.	Session day arrives: client logs in via secure link, therapist sees them in the waiting area or starts the call.
7.	Session completes: a Draft Note is available in the “Documentation” tab, encouraging the therapist to finalize the session note promptly.
________________________________________
Benefits & Rationale
•	Streamlined Telehealth: Minimizing confusion around time zones and availability ensures the client and therapist connect smoothly.
•	Reduced Administrative Burden: Automated checks for conflicts and pre-session tasks reduce manual follow-up or risk of scheduling errors.
•	Improved Compliance & Preparation: Pre-session forms and homework integrated into the scheduling process fosters a well-prepared session, leading to more effective therapy.
•	Enhanced Engagement: Clients get immediate feedback—knowing what tasks to complete, which forms to sign—thus staying active in their own care.
________________________________________
Reminders & Confirmations in a Telehealth Environment
1. Automated Email/SMS Reminders
1.	Configurable Timing
o	The EHR allows staff or clinicians to set how far in advance an automated reminder is sent—e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, or 1 week before the telehealth session.
o	Practices can choose multiple reminders (e.g., one at 48 hours and another at 2 hours) for high no-show risk clients.
2.	Email vs. SMS
o	Email Reminders: Typically include session details (date, time, telehealth link, any forms the client should complete).
o	SMS/Text Reminders: More concise (e.g., “Reminder: Your telehealth appointment with Dr. [Name] is on [Date/Time]. Check your portal for the session link.”).
o	Clients can opt in or out of either channel per practice or local regulations.
3.	Customization
o	The practice can upload a logo or brand colors if the reminder is an HTML email.
o	The reminder template can contain disclaimers (e.g., “This is not an emergency line,” “Please do not share personal info via SMS.”).
4.	Telehealth Link Integration
o	If the EHR auto-generates a unique video session link, it can embed that link directly in the reminder.
o	Alternatively, the reminder can direct the client to the client portal to access the link securely.
________________________________________
2. Tracking Client Confirmations or Cancellations
1.	Confirmation Mechanisms
o	One-Click Confirmation in Email: The client’s email reminder may have a “Confirm” button. Clicking it updates the EHR to show the appointment as confirmed, letting the therapist see who is likely to attend.
o	SMS Reply: For text reminders, the system might support a short code—client replies “C” to confirm, “R” to reschedule, “X” to cancel, etc.
o	Client Portal: Some clients prefer to confirm or cancel from their portal account, which updates in real time.
2.	Real-Time Dashboard Update
o	Once the client confirms or cancels, the EHR immediately reflects that status in the scheduling module (e.g., turning the appointment color to green for “confirmed,” or crossing it out for “canceled”).
o	The therapist receives a quick in-app or email notification if a client cancels less than X hours beforehand, prompting a potential no-show or late cancellation scenario.
3.	Client Initiated Reschedule
o	Clients can optionally request a reschedule from the portal or by replying to SMS.
o	The EHR holds it as “Pending Staff Approval” if the practice wants a final say, or automatically suggests new open slots from the therapist’s schedule.
4.	No-Show Tracking
o	If the client fails to confirm or attend, the system might automatically tag the session as a “No Show” after a certain time passes (e.g., 15 minutes into the session).
o	This generates a log for potential fee enforcement or follow-up.
________________________________________
3. Policies for Rescheduling or Late Cancellation Fees
1.	Customizable Policy Settings
o	The practice can define how many hours/days in advance a client must cancel to avoid a late fee (e.g., 24 hours).
o	That rule is baked into the EHR’s scheduling logic, so cancellations within that window trigger an internal flag: “Possible Late Cancellation.”
2.	Fee Enforcement
o	If a client cancels under the allowed time, the EHR can automatically generate a note or a billing line item (e.g., “Late Cancellation Fee: $X”).
o	Alternatively, staff can manually approve or waive the fee if the client has an extenuating circumstance.
3.	Client Acknowledgment
o	During booking (or in the client’s portal), the system can display a short statement: “By scheduling, you agree to pay a $X fee if canceling less than 24 hours before your session.”
o	This fosters transparency about the policy.
4.	Tracking & Reporting
o	A “Late Cancellation or No-Show” report can be generated monthly or weekly to see how often clients are missing sessions.
o	If needed, the practice might follow up with frequent no-show clients or revise the policy based on repeated patterns.
________________________________________
Example Workflow: Automated Reminder to Confirmation
1.	Session Scheduled: The telehealth appointment is created for, say, 2 PM, next Tuesday.
2.	Reminder Configuration: The practice’s default is to send an email reminder 48 hours before, plus an SMS 2 hours before.
3.	Client Receives 48-Hour Email: 
o	The email includes the telehealth link, appointment date/time in the client’s local time zone, and a “Confirm” button.
o	The client clicks “Confirm.”
4.	EHR Update: The system logs “Client Confirmed” in the scheduling notes. The appointment color changes to green.
5.	2-Hour SMS: A shorter text is sent, reminding them to be ready. They join the session on time.
6.	No Show Scenario: If the client never confirms nor attends, the system automatically marks “No Show” after the session passes. The practice may apply a fee per their policy.
________________________________________
Benefits & Rationale
1.	Reduced No-Show Rate: Frequent, clear reminders lead to fewer missed appointments.
2.	Client Autonomy: The ability to confirm/cancel with minimal friction fosters a sense of control for the client.
3.	Automated Fee Enforcement: Late cancellations can be tracked consistently, eliminating guesswork for billing staff.
4.	Transparent Communication: The system ensures clients are fully aware of cancellation policies, fees, and any forms they need to complete.
________________________________________
6. Administrative Management
6.1 Practice Overview Dashboard
A. High-Level Metrics
A centralized, visually engaging dashboard displays the key data points for the entire telehealth mental health practice. The design prioritizes clarity and actionable insights, ensuring administrators can quickly see what requires attention.
1.	Active Clients
o	Total Active Clients: The number of clients currently in treatment.
o	New Clients This Month: The count of recently registered/starting therapy in the current calendar month.
o	Upcoming Birthday
o	Upcoming Intakes
o	Cancelled Appointments
o	Upcoming Appointments (next 6 days)
o	Discharged Clients: The number of clients who completed or discontinued therapy in the last 30 days.
2.	Attendance & No-Show Rate
o	No-Show Percentage: A chart tracking how many scheduled telehealth sessions did not occur because the client didn’t log in or canceled late.
o	Cancellation Statistics: A breakdown (e.g., “24-hour notice cancellations,” “same-day cancellations”).
o	Trends Over Time: A line or bar graph showing changes in no-show/cancellation rates monthly, so admins can spot patterns and propose solutions (like more frequent reminders).
3.	Unsigned or Overdue Notes
o	Count of Draft/Overdue Notes: If a note remains in draft status past the practice’s compliance window (e.g., 48 hours), it flags here.
o	Therapist Breakdown: A color-coded list of how many unsigned notes each clinician has.
o	Quick Link: An “Address Now” button that takes the user to a list of all overdue notes for immediate follow-up.
4.	Revenue Summaries
o	Total Billed vs. Received: A real-time snapshot of the month’s billing totals vs. actual payments collected.
o	Insurance vs. Self-Pay: Pie chart or bar graph illustrating the ratio of revenue streams (e.g., 70% insurance reimbursements, 30% out-of-pocket).
o	Pending Claims: The number of insurance claims still under review or unpaid, along with the total dollar amount at stake.
5.	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
o	Average Sessions per Client: Helps gauge engagement or therapy length for an average client.
o	Staff Utilization: The average percentage of booked telehealth slots per provider.
o	Client Satisfaction Score (if using post-session surveys): e.g., “4.5 / 5 average rating this month.”
________________________________________
B. Alerts & Notifications
To prevent crucial tasks from slipping through the cracks, the system provides real-time alerts in the admin’s dashboard.
1.	Upcoming Staff License Expirations
o	License Renewal List: A widget or pop-up listing each staff member whose license will expire within the next 60 or 90 days.
o	Email or In-App Reminders: Automatic notifications can be sent to the staff member and their supervisor/administrator 30 days before the expiration date.
o	Smart Escalation: If the license is still not updated 2 weeks before expiration, the system can highlight it in red or send daily alerts.
2.	System Tasks / Announcements
o	Form Updates: If a new telehealth consent form or updated HIPAA policy is released, the system prompts administrators to review and roll it out to staff and clients.
o	Software Patches or Upgrades: If the EHR vendor pushes an update requiring user action or downtime, the system displays a scheduled maintenance banner.
o	Staff Onboarding/Offboarding: Reminders if new staff need their EHR account set up (roles, permissions, schedules) or if departing staff accounts must be deactivated.
3.	Policy & Procedure Reminders
o	If the practice has a periodic policy review requirement (e.g., annual telehealth policy renewal), the admin dashboard can show which policies are due for revision.
o	Encourages leadership to keep official guidelines fresh and staff informed.
________________________________________
C. Advanced Metrics & Trending Analysis (Optional Enhancements)
1.	Month-over-Month Growth
o	Revenue Growth Rate: Compare the current month’s revenue to the previous month.
o	Client Growth Rate: Track how many new clients started therapy vs. how many were discharged or completed in the same period.
2.	Therapist Productivity Trends
o	Graphs illustrating each clinician’s session volume over time, no-show rate for their caseload, and average note completion time.
o	Helps identify if a clinician might be overloaded (rising no-show could correlate with scheduling times that are not convenient for clients) or if an intern requires additional supervision.
3.	Outcomes Tracking (If integrated with standardized measures)
o	If the practice uses routine outcome measures (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7), a broad-level dashboard could show average improvements or changes in client symptom severity.
o	This helps demonstrate overall clinical efficacy to stakeholders.
4.	Insurance Payer Statistics
o	Summaries of top 3 or 5 payers by volume, average reimbursement time, denial rate, etc.
o	Admins can see if a certain payer consistently denies claims or delays payment, enabling negotiation or adjusted approaches.
________________________________________
D. Role-Based Access & Customization
1.	Who Sees This Dashboard?
o	Administrators & Clinical Directors: Full overview (metrics, alerts, revenue).
o	Supervisors: May see staff performance metrics and license deadlines for their supervisees.
o	Individual Therapists: Possibly see a simplified version focusing on their own active clients, overdue notes, and own license alerts.
o	Each role sees only the relevant subset of metrics to maintain privacy and protect sensitive financial or staff info.
2.	Dashboard Customization
o	Users can rearrange or hide certain widgets (e.g., a lead clinical director might want to see more clinical outcomes, while an admin might prioritize revenue stats).
o	Color Scheme & Branding: The practice can brand the dashboard with its logo and color palette, consistent with the rest of the EHR.
________________________________________
E. Practical Workflow Examples
1.	Morning Overview
o	An Admin logs in each morning, sees a “Heads-Up” area listing: 
	“3 staff licenses expiring within 30 days”
	“5 unsigned notes from yesterday”
	“No-show rate last week at 7% (down 2% from prior week).”
o	They can quickly decide: “I’ll email those staff about renewing licenses, remind the therapists to sign their notes, and celebrate the lower no-show rate.”
2.	End-of-Month Review
o	Admin or CFO checks the Revenue Summaries widget for total billing vs. collected amounts, sees a shortfall in insurance reimbursements. Drills down to see which claims are pending or denied. This guides next steps with the billing team.
3.	Proactive License Management
o	A staff member’s license is expiring in 45 days. They receive an auto-email from the EHR with instructions or forms for renewal. The system flags it on the admin’s dashboard, so they can follow up as needed.
4.	Updating Key Forms
o	The practice decides to revise the “Telehealth Consent Form” or “Client Intake History Form.” The system alerts the admin that staff need to adopt the new version. Admin can track which staff have reviewed the updated forms or not.
________________________________________
F. Benefits & Rationale
1.	Real-Time Insights
o	The high-level metrics give leadership an instant pulse on practice performance: client flow, missed sessions, financial health, and crucial tasks.
2.	Streamlined Oversight
o	Automatic license expiration alerts, mandatory form updates, and unsent notes are surfaced proactively, reducing last-minute scrambles or compliance crises.
3.	Enhanced Decision Making
o	Historical and trending data (no-show rates, revenue patterns, staff productivity) can drive strategic changes—like adjusting telehealth hours or focusing on staff training to reduce overdue notes.
4.	Customized Views
o	Each admin or director can tune the dashboard to their responsibilities, ensuring efficiency and data privacy.


________________________________________
Staff Management: Onboarding & Setup
1. Capturing Credentials & Initial Profile Setup
1.	Basic Information
o	Name, Contact Details (email, phone), and Practice Role (e.g., Therapist, Supervisor, Administrative Staff).
o	Preferred Time Zone: Essential for telehealth scheduling to avoid confusion across different regions.
2.	Licenses & Certifications
o	License Number: E.g., for an LPC, LCSW, LMFT, or Psychologist.
o	License Expiration Date: The system uses this to generate reminders (e.g., 60 or 90 days before expiration).
o	Issuing Board & State: Important when verifying if the staff can practice telehealth across certain states.
o	Upload or Document Evidence: Possibly attach scanned certificates or license verifications for legal records.
3.	Specialties & Modalities (Optional)
o	If the therapist specializes in DBT, EMDR, Substance Use counseling, Family Therapy, etc., the EHR can list these for matching clients to providers.
o	Language Fluencies (English, Spanish, ASL, etc.) to ensure the system or practice can route clients effectively.
4.	Onboarding Documents
o	The system can prompt the new staff member to e-sign the practice’s telehealth policies or an employment contract.
o	If staff need training resources (like platform tutorials or HIPAA best practices), the EHR can link to them and track completion.
________________________________________
2. Role Assignment & Permissions
1.	Role Definitions
o	Clinician (Therapist): Full access to client charts, scheduling, note creation, e-sign.
o	Supervisor: May have the same access as a clinician plus the ability to co-sign supervisee notes, view performance dashboards, or handle staff oversight tasks.
o	Admin / Practice Manager: Broad access to billing, reporting, staff management dashboards, but may have limited or no access to clinical notes (depending on privacy policy).
o	Billing Specialist: Access to revenue summaries, claims management, insurance details, but typically not to full therapy notes.
o	Support Staff / Scheduler: If relevant, can manage the telehealth scheduling interface, create appointments, and confirm client details, but with minimal or no access to clinical notes.
2.	Permission Matrix
o	The EHR can define a matrix detailing which roles can: 
	View vs. Edit client records,
	Lock/Sign notes,
	Run specific reports (like no-show rates or billing statements).
o	Customizable: If the practice has unique roles (e.g., Peer Support, Intern), it can adapt the matrix for those roles.
3.	User Groups or Teams (Optional)
o	If the practice organizes staff into teams (e.g., Child & Adolescent track, Substance Use track), the EHR can assign the new user to the relevant group, controlling which clients or forms they can access.
________________________________________
3. Schedule & Availability Setup
Because the practice is telehealth-only, staff scheduling revolves around online session times and possible time zone differences:
1.	Defining Available Hours
o	Each new staff member sets their telehealth availability—days of the week, start/end times, breaks.
o	The EHR can convert these hours to a unified practice time zone for consistent scheduling or store them as local to the staff’s region.
2.	Preferred Session Types
o	If a therapist only handles Individual Therapy or does not do Group or Couples sessions, the system marks that.
o	This ensures that scheduling or admin staff do not inadvertently book them for a session type they don’t provide.
3.	Recurring Time Off or Appointment Blocks
o	If the staff has a recurring personal block (e.g., every Tuesday from 1-2 PM for supervision or personal lunch break), they can block it in their schedule. The system flags that time as “Unavailable” so no telehealth sessions are placed there.
4.	Synchronized Calendar (Optional)
o	The EHR might allow staff to sync with an external calendar (Google, iCal) to avoid double-booking or to see personal commitments. This requires suitable privacy controls to ensure client data remains secure.
________________________________________
4. Verification & Compliance Checks
1.	License Verification
o	Onboarding includes verifying the staff’s license with the issuing board, ensuring they’re in good standing.
o	EHR can store verification date and next check date if the practice mandates periodic re-verifications.
2.	Background Checks (If Required)
o	If the practice requires background checks, the EHR can track the date, the source of the check, and store a “pass/fail” status or relevant documents.
3.	Agreements to Telehealth Policies
o	Because it’s a telehealth-specific role, staff might need to sign extra disclaimers or confirm they understand telehealth boundaries, HIPAA compliance for remote work, etc.
4.	Automatic Alerts
o	If a staff’s license is near expiration or if any mandatory documents are not uploaded, the system issues alerts to both the staff member and admin.
o	The EHR might block scheduling sessions if the staff’s license is expired to avoid compliance violations.
________________________________________
5. Tracking Staff Progress & Orientation
1.	Orientation Tasks
o	The EHR can present a “New Staff Checklist”: 
	Step 1: Watch telehealth platform tutorial.
	Step 2: Complete HIPAA training.
	Step 3: Upload e-signature or confirm electronic signature method.
	Step 4: Configure personal schedule.
o	Each completed item is checked off, giving the staff member and admin an overview of orientation progress.
2.	Supervision & Co-Sign Requirements (If Associate Staff)
o	If the new user is an intern or associate-level counselor, the system links them to a supervisor.
o	All notes automatically go into “Pending Co-Sign” status for that supervisor’s approval until the staff obtains full licensure.
3.	Performance & Productivity
o	Over time, the EHR can display staff’s session volume, no-show rates, client satisfaction (if relevant data is collected). The system can store basic orientation feedback from the staff or from their supervisor about how well the new hire integrated.
________________________________________
6. Role-Based Dashboards & Access
1.	Therapist Dashboard
o	Summarizes daily telehealth appointments, unsent notes, or tasks such as finishing an intake summary.
o	Quick links to client charts, “Start Session” for telehealth links, and a personal schedule block.
2.	Supervisor Dashboard
o	Additional insight into supervisees’ assigned clients, whether their notes are signed or require co-signature.
o	Alerts if an associate counselor is behind on documentation.
3.	Administrative Dashboard
o	Staff management overview listing all staff credentials, license expiry dates, orientation statuses.
o	Provides monthly usage or telehealth session counts, staff coverage.
4.	Billing Specialist Access
o	Allows the new staff member if they’re in billing to see revenue data, insurance claims, claims statuses—but not clinical notes.
o	Ensures each role sees only what they need.
________________________________________
7. Practical Example Workflow
1.	Admin Adds a New Therapist
o	Enters basic data (name, email), license #, expiration date, telehealth certification (if applicable).
o	Chooses “Therapist” role; sets privileges for editing notes, scheduling, accessing client charts.
2.	Therapist Receives Invitation
o	Clicks a link to finalize their profile, uploading license docs and e-signing the practice’s telehealth policy.
o	Sets their telehealth schedule: Monday-Thursday, 9 AM to 5 PM in Eastern Time.
3.	EHR Verification
o	Admin checks the system, sees the license expires in 7 months, so the system auto-sets a reminder 90 days prior.
o	The therapist is assigned to “Adults, Individual Therapy” categories.
4.	Orientation & Start
o	The new therapist’s dashboard shows a checklist: watch EHR tutorial, confirm e-signature setup, etc.
o	After completing orientation, the therapist can receive first client assignments or schedule availability opens up for direct client self-scheduling.
5.	Ongoing Checks
o	One month in, the admin or clinical director logs in to see how many telehealth sessions the new therapist has done, no-show rates, etc. All data is visible in staff management “Performance” or “Productivity” module.
________________________________________

6. Administrative Management

1. Navigating to the “Staff” Section
1.	Staff Overview Page
o	The top bar or side menu includes a “Staff” option. Clicking it brings up a list of existing users with columns such as Full Name, Mobile Phone, License Exp, Roles, 2FA status, and more.
o	A “Show Inactive Users” button may toggle between current and former staff, while a “+ New User” button initiates the onboarding process.
2.	+ New User
o	Admins (with permission to manage staff) click “+ New User”, launching a form or multi-step wizard. This leads to a page titled “Add a New User” with multiple tabs: Info, Scheduling, Billing, Patients, To-Do, Work Schedule, Files, and Notifications (some tabs may appear after saving basic info).
________________________________________
2. Roles & Access Selection
1.	Roles Panel
o	A central section titled “Roles” includes checkboxes for Practice Administration, Clinician, Intern/Assistant/Associate, Supervisor, Clinical Administrator, Practice Scheduler, Practice Biller, etc.
o	Each role has a brief definition: for instance, a “Practice Scheduler” can create and manage appointments for all clinicians but can’t see clinical notes. A “Practice Biller” focuses on insurance claims and copays. A “Clinician” can see and finalize their own therapy notes, etc.
2.	Role Combinations
o	Because it’s a telehealth mental health practice, many staff might be Clinician + Practice Biller for assigned clients, or Clinician + Supervisor if they need co-sign responsibilities.
o	Some roles require others—e.g., Clinical Administrator must also be a Clinician.
3.	User Comments
o	A field labeled “User Comments” allows an admin to note scheduling/billing preferences or relevant internal remarks. All staff can see these “comments,” functioning like a handy tooltip or note for the user’s profile.
________________________________________
3. User Information Form
1.	Basic Contact Fields
o	Name (first & last)
o	User Name (login credentials, often short or initial-based).
o	Email: The user’s primary email for notifications, password resets, or 2FA setup.
o	Mobile Phone, Work Phone, Home Phone: The system can label which is default or “can receive text messages,” a checkbox to indicate permission.
o	Address (for official records), Zip, City/State: Telehealth might not require a physical office address, but the practice may store staff’s mailing info.
2.	Type of Clinician
o	A dropdown: Counselor, Social Worker, Psychologist, Psychiatrist, etc.
o	Formal Name & Title: e.g., “Sarah Allen, Ph.D.” or “John Smith, LPC.” This is how the user’s name might display on client portals or documents.
3.	NPI & Supervision
o	If they have an Individual NPI (Type 1), it’s entered here. Some staff might be interns or not require an NPI.
o	Supervision field: “Not Supervised” or if they must be co-signed by a specific supervisor, it’s chosen here.
o	Languages: e.g., English (Primary), Spanish, French. This helps in matching clients.
4.	Licenses
o	Under “Licenses,” the user can click “+ New License” to add State/Number, Taxonomy, Expiration date.
o	This is crucial for the EHR to track upcoming license renewals and send alerts.
5.	2FA & Security (once the user is created)
o	The system can prompt them to enroll in two-factor authentication for HIPAA and data security compliance.
o	The admin can see if the user is “Not Enrolled in Two-Factor Authentication” and encourage them to set it up.
________________________________________
4. Scheduling & Work Schedule
After saving the initial “Info,” more tabs like “Work Schedule” or “Scheduling” appear:
1.	Client Portal Scheduling
o	Check if the user’s portal scheduling features are enabled or disabled. Some staff (like a pure admin) might not have a personal schedule for clients to book.
2.	Work Schedule Tab
o	Lists the staff’s regular telehealth availability: “Monday from 10:00AM to 2:00PM,” “Thursday from 6:00PM to 8:30PM,” etc.
o	Each entry indicates a “HIPAA Compliant Telehealth Platform (Default)” or any custom label.
o	If the user works multiple shifts or days, these are enumerated in a bullet list.
3.	Locations (If needed)
o	For a purely telehealth environment, the user might have just one default location: “HIPAA Compliant Telehealth Platform.” But if staff occasionally do in-person sessions at a certain site, it can be added here.
4.	Editing Schedule
o	The user or an admin can click “Edit” to open an interface to add or remove time blocks. They specify start/end times and the platform or location.
o	This ensures telehealth sessions can be automatically matched to staff availability.
________________________________________
5. Additional Tabs: Billing, Patients, To-Do, Files, Notifications
1.	Billing (If relevant)
o	Under the “Billing” tab, the staff might set how they bill insurance: 
	“Bill under supervisor (incident-to) for all payers” if they’re an intern.
	“Has own credentials for all payers.”
o	If they are a “Practice Biller,” they see advanced billing settings or claims management access.
2.	Patients
o	If the user is a Clinician, they can view their assigned patients in this tab, or an Admin can manage which clients are assigned to them.
o	Alternatively, a non-clinical role might not see “Patients” at all.
3.	To-Do
o	A personal task list for staff: orientation tasks, reminders to sign a certain note, or license renewal tasks.
o	Admin can assign tasks to the user (e.g., “Complete compliance training by Friday”).
4.	Files
o	The staff’s own document repository. They can upload certificates, extra disclaimers, or any official docs.
o	The practice can store contract PDFs or orientation materials here, so the staff can reference them.
5.	Notifications
o	The user can set preferences: get email or text alerts for new assigned patients, session cancellations, or upcoming note deadlines.
o	2FA reminders and security logs might appear if the user’s device or IP changes.
________________________________________
6. Post-Creation & Maintenance
1.	View & Edit Staff Profile
o	Once created, the staff’s “Info” page displays details: Name, user name, type of clinician, roles, supervision requirements, last login time, IP address, license info, languages, etc.
o	A snapshot of Security & Activity can show the user’s browser or last login date.
2.	Status: Active or Inactive
o	If staff leave or take an extended break, the practice can mark them “Inactive,” removing scheduling or note-taking privileges but preserving historical data.
o	The “Show Inactive Users” toggle re-displays them if needed.
3.	Ongoing Compliance
o	The system automatically flags upcoming license expirations, incomplete required forms, or if the staff hasn’t logged in recently but has assigned clients.
o	The Admin can reset the user’s password or help them enable two-factor authentication from the same screen.
________________________________________
1. Monitoring Staff Workloads (Telehealth Context)
A. Workload Dashboard & Metrics
1.	Weekly Session Count
o	Each clinician has a "Sessions This Week" metric showing how many telehealth appointments they completed or have scheduled in the coming days.
o	Admins can see at a glance which clinicians are nearing capacity (e.g., 25+ sessions per week) vs. who might have room for new clients.
2.	Active Caseload
o	A “Clients in Active Treatment” count for each staff member, listing how many are newly admitted vs. in ongoing therapy.
o	For telehealth, the system may also track time-zone distribution (if a clinician sees clients from multiple regions) or treatment type distribution (individual, group, couples).
3.	Session Distribution
o	The EHR can produce a small graph or bar chart of each provider’s sessions across the week (Monday–Sunday). Helps administrators see how appointments are spread out—are they heavily stacked on certain days? Are certain midday slots going unused?
4.	No-Show & Late Cancel Trends
o	Clinicians in a telehealth practice might face unique no-show/cancellation patterns. The EHR can show which staff members experience higher no-show rates, potentially indicating scheduling or engagement issues.
o	If one provider’s no-show rate is significantly higher, the system prompts leadership to investigate if certain session times or telehealth links cause confusion, or if certain clients need extra reminders.
5.	Capacity & Overload Alerts
o	If a therapist surpasses an admin-set threshold (e.g., 30 sessions/week or 40 clients total), the EHR can flag them in amber or red. This helps maintain mental health staff’s well-being by preventing unintentional overload.
________________________________________
B. Real-Time Availability & Scheduling Integration
1.	Calendar Link
o	The workload view ties directly to each clinician’s telehealth scheduling blocks. Admin or managers can see who might be free to take a new intake if a client is requesting immediate placement.
2.	Availability Conflicts
o	If a staff member’s schedule is already full in a certain time zone block, the system warns administrators to avoid further booking or reassign those clients to other staff.
3.	Multi-Clinician Cases (e.g., co-therapy)
o	Telehealth sometimes involves multiple providers in a single session. The EHR workload module can note that each provider is partially occupying that time slot, ensuring no double-booking.
________________________________________
2. Checking Compliance (Overdue Documentation, Etc.)
A. Overdue Notes & Documentation
1.	Compliance Dashboard
o	A practice-wide list of all unsent or in-draft notes that exceeded the allowed timeframe (e.g., 48 hours). Each entry includes: 
	Clinician’s Name
	Client’s Name
	Session Date
	Days Overdue
o	Staff can sort or filter by clinician, highlighting if one staff member has multiple overdue items.
2.	Alert Mechanisms
o	In-App Notifications: A red badge near the user’s “Documentation” tab if they have overdue notes.
o	Email Reminders: Optional daily or weekly emails to staff with a summary of incomplete or unsigned notes.
o	Escalation: After a certain threshold (e.g., 7 days), a supervisor or admin is also notified to intervene.
3.	Lock/Sign
o	The EHR enforces e-signature or co-sign for interns or unlicensed providers. If co-sign is overdue, it appears in the compliance view.
o	The system can show how many notes are “Pending Co-Sign” vs. how many are fully locked.
4.	Treatment Plan Reviews
o	Similarly, if a plan is due for a 30/60/90-day review, the system flags it as “Plan Review Overdue” or “Due in 7 days.”
o	Tying compliance checks for documentation ensures every active client’s plan remains up to date in a telehealth setting.
________________________________________
3. Staff Productivity & Performance
A. Productivity Metrics
1.	Sessions Completed per Week/Month
o	Graphs or charts show how many telehealth sessions each staff conducted over time. This helps leadership see steady vs. fluctuating volumes.
o	Additionally, a ratio of “Booked sessions” to “Attended sessions” can indicate a staff member’s engagement success (lower no-shows) or scheduling strategy.
2.	Average Session Length
o	If the EHR logs exact session start/end times (e.g., in telehealth platforms with built-in timers), staff can see the typical duration of their sessions. Some payers require a certain minimum time for billing certain codes.
3.	Documentation Turnaround
o	The system can measure how long it takes each staff member to finalize a session note from session end time to note sign-off.
o	If there’s a policy to finalize within 24 hours, staff with repeated tardiness can be gently reminded or offered time management support.
4.	Client Feedback / Satisfaction Scores (Optional)
o	If post-session surveys or end-of-treatment satisfaction forms are used, average scores per clinician can be aggregated.
o	This provides an approximate measure of how clients perceive the telehealth experience with that provider.
________________________________________
B. Client Retention Reports
1.	Retention Rate Formula
o	A standard approach might be: Client Retention Rate=(Active Clients at End of Period−New Clients During PeriodActive Clients at Start of Period)×100% \text{Client Retention Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Active Clients at End of Period} - \text{New Clients During Period}}{\text{Active Clients at Start of Period}} \right) \times 100\% 
o	In telehealth mental health, retention might reflect how many clients continue therapy vs. drop out after a few sessions.
2.	Tracking & Visualization
o	The EHR can generate a monthly or quarterly retention chart. Each staff’s retention might differ, e.g., a specialized trauma therapist might see clients for shorter but intense durations, affecting “retention” differently.
o	Also, breakdown by discharge reasons (completed treatment vs. client ended early, unable to pay, or found in-person therapy, etc.).
3.	No-Show vs. Retention Correlation
o	Possibly show if repeated no-shows lead to client discontinuation or if certain appointment times lead to better retention.
o	This helps staff refine scheduling strategies or engagement methods.
4.	Automatic Alerts for Rapid Drop-offs
o	If a client stops scheduling after 1–2 telehealth sessions, the EHR can track that as an “early termination.” This might prompt admin or staff to do a follow-up call or offer alternative scheduling.
________________________________________
4. Reports & Analytics
A. Comprehensive Reports
1.	Staff Performance Summary
o	A table or chart that collates each staff member’s: 
	Weekly session average,
	No-show/cancellation rate,
	Overdue doc count,
	Retention rate or average length of client engagement,
	Possibly revenue if each staff bills individually.
2.	Drill-Down
o	Clicking a staff member’s name can open more detailed breakdowns: session types used (Individual vs. Group), client demographics, average note finalization time, etc.
3.	Goal Setting & Quarterly Reviews
o	Admin or clinical directors can set performance goals (e.g., reduce overdue notes by 50%, maintain 80% average retention). The EHR updates them on progress and provides trending data each quarter.
4.	Export & Sharing
o	The system can export a PDF or spreadsheet for staff meetings, or for external consultants if the practice is evaluating efficiency.
o	For telehealth, it’s especially beneficial to share these data points with staff working from different locations so everyone sees the same metrics.
________________________________________
B. Personalized Dashboards
1.	Staff Self-View
o	Each therapist has a “My Performance” widget: 
	Sessions booked vs. attended,
	No-show rate,
	Overdue doc count,
	Current retention or average length of client relationships.
o	Encourages self-awareness and self-driven improvement.
2.	Supervisor/Admin Overlay
o	Supervisors see all staff under their supervision, with the ability to message or nudge those needing help.
o	Admin sees the entire practice, focusing on outliers who might be over capacity or behind in documentation.
________________________________________
5. Actionable Workflows & Telehealth Relevance
1.	Real-Time Telehealth Monitoring
o	Because everything is virtual, these dashboards must update quickly after each telehealth session ends (e.g., session logs the completion time).
o	Overdue note timers start ticking once the telehealth session is logged as “finished.”
2.	As-Needed Interventions
o	If staff show a repeated pattern of overdue docs, an alert might suggest scheduling an administrative or supervisor check-in.
o	If retention dips, the practice can look into client engagement strategies—maybe more robust telehealth reminders, group therapy options, or adjusting session lengths.
3.	Supporting Staff Well-Being
o	Telehealth can blur lines between personal and work time. Monitoring session volumes ensures staff aren’t unknowingly taking 10 sessions in a row.
o	The system can gently remind clinicians to build in breaks or “off hours” in their schedule.
4.	Multi-State Licensing
o	For telehealth providers licensed in multiple states, the system can track whether they have more clients from one state vs. another, or if any license is nearing expiration, factoring into “compliance checks.”
________________________________________
