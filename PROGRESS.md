### 2023-04-02
- Fixed broken Messages component
  - Created a new Messages.tsx component to replace the broken messages.tsx.broken file
  - Implemented proper error handling in the component
  - Fixed styling and syntax issues throughout the component
  - Connected the component to the new error handling system

- Improved error handling system
  - Created standardized error handling utilities for frontend (errorHandler.ts)
  - Enhanced API request utility to use consistent error handling (apiRequest.ts)
  - Created a custom hook for API error handling (useApiError.ts)
  - Added proper toast notifications for errors
  - Connected frontend error handling with backend error handling system

- Added necessary UI components
  - Implemented Button, Avatar, Input, Textarea, Card, Dialog, Select, and Tooltip components
  - Created utility functions for className management (cn.ts)
  - Improved UI consistency across the application
  - Updated package.json to include required dependencies

- Added component documentation
  - Updated README.md with error handling system documentation
  - Updated PROGRESS.md to track recent changes
  - Added proper JSDoc comments to utility functions and components

These improvements have addressed the frontend issues noted in the stabilization phase, establishing a more robust foundation for further development.

### 2023-04-03
- Enhanced testing coverage across the application
  - Added unit tests for critical frontend utilities
    - Created errorHandler.test.ts for testing error handling utilities
    - Created apiRequest.test.ts for testing API request functionality
    - Created useApiError.test.ts for testing error handling hooks
  - Added integration tests for key components
    - Created Messages.test.tsx for testing the Messages component
    - Created error-handling.test.ts for testing API error handling
  - Implemented E2E tests for critical user flows
    - Created messaging-flow.e2e.test.ts for testing the messaging workflow
  - Improved test infrastructure and setup
    - Added proper test mocks for external dependencies
    - Set up test fixtures for consistent testing data
    - Created testing utilities for common testing tasks

- These tests address the testing coverage gaps identified in the stabilization phase:
  - âœ… Unit tests for critical utility functions are now in place
  - âœ… Integration tests for key API endpoints are now complete
  - âœ… E2E tests are now implemented for critical user flows

The test suite now provides much greater confidence in the codebase, with comprehensive testing across all layers of the application.

## API Architecture Refinement
- âœ… Standardized API response formats (server/utils/api-response.ts implemented with success, error, and pagination responses)
- âœ… Request validation using Zod implemented (server/middleware/validation.ts)
- âœ… Pagination for list endpoints added (server/utils/pagination.ts)
- âœ… API documentation created (server/docs directory)
- âœ… All endpoints standardized (legacy routes with the old format marked as deprecated)
